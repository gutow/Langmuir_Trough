# Trough Controller
This software is a custom controller for the research Langmuir trough in the
Gutow Lab at UW Oshkosh. It is written in Python and expects to run in a
Jupyter notebook environment. However, all of the parts that are not elements
of the user interface should work in a vanilla Python environment.

Hardware requirements:
Raspberry Pi compatible system with a Pi-Plates DAQC2 data acquisition plate.
